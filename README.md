Project definition-
The Ecommerce store is designed basically in three different modules they are GUI module, Database module, GUI & Database communication  module. 
GUI Module basically deals with the design of the interface which include the service of providing the user with the flexibility of accessing 
the data and selecting the required data.It should also provide the system to collect the information from the user to check the authorization
in providing the access to ecommerce store. The interface is also to consider the design, which include the services of sending and receiving of
the data with encryption and decryption standards.The Database module basically deals with storing the data, which can be accessed very easily.
With reduction in the uploading time. Communication module considers the implementation of the encryptions and decryption standards in  the 
transfer of data from one module to another in a distributed environment. The system design, even need to support the user to select the level
of encryption he/she needs to perform depending upon the data to be transferred. The basic algorithm used for password is the MD5 algorithm 
where the user can enter the key depending upon level encryption he is interested. The Communication Module deals with the architecture, which 
supports the system to identify the end users for the communication and establish the communication.Connection and disconnection of the
communication channel between the users for the access of data and file transfer services. PHP language is used for server side scripting. 
PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source generalpurpose scripting language that is especially 
suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is
executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would
not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really
no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve. The best things in using PHP are that it is extremely simple for a newcomer, 
but offers many advanced features for a professional programmer. You can jump in, in a short time, and start writing simple scripts in a few 
hours.
